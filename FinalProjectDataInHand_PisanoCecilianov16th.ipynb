    "2. #### TheDogAPI's no-key image metadata endpoint would return a list of image objects, each with an imageID, Url and dimensions and with breeds array. Each breed object would include detail such as name, breed group, temperament, life span, origin and weight + height in both sets of units (metric and imperial). Traits would follow this consistent format and structure as they can be easily used into tidy tables for the analysis on their breeds, weights or life spans. The rows would depend on how much data i'd use. At this point it is possible to be a 6-7 Columns with however amount of rows i'd like using head() to get an accurate description or array of breeds in my final project data. By using Median for weight, height or life span it would give a stable range. The mean could be best for the averages on data which could be best used in computing the mean weight or height across breeds."

The structure makes the data to be easily put into a table for comparison being its strong suit for this type of data."
